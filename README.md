# ezGBA

**No hotkeys. No combos. No menus to get lost in. Simple, simple, simple.**

ezGBA turns an Anbernic RG SP into a Game Boy Advance that anyone can pick up and play.
Made for kids, and for grown-ups who just want a simple GBA.

This fork is laid out for the **RG35XXSP** and its 640×480 screen.

## See it in action

| Pick a game, play, eject | Brightness on L2/R2 | Close the lid, pick up where you left off |

| <img src="media/play-and-eject.webp" width="240" alt="Pressing A starts Zelda; MENU ejects back to the shelf"> | <img src="media/brightness.webp" width="240" alt="L2 and R2 dim and brighten the screen"> | <img src="media/lid-close-and-resume.webp" width="240" alt="Closing the lid mid-game, reopening, then powering on from off and resuming"> |
| A starts it. MENU ejects it. | One press, one step. | Your game is always saved. |

## How it works

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **D-pad** | Pick a game |
| **A** | Play it |
| **MENU** | In a game: save and go back to your games. On the shelf: settings. |
| **L2 / R2** | Screen darker / brighter |
| **Close the lid** | Saves and sleeps. Open it within 3 minutes to keep playing. After that it turns itself off to save battery, and the next time you turn it on, your game picks up right where you left off. |

That's everything. Every button does one thing, on its own. No holding, no combos.

## What's different from slot.

ezGBA is built on [slot.](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot). Here's what changed:

- **No hotkeys.** No button combos to learn or hit by accident.
- **L2/R2 control brightness.** In slot. they rewind and fast-forward the game, which is
  easy to press by accident mid-game.
- **One tap of MENU saves and ejects.** slot. needs MENU held for about a second.
- **The game's box art fills the screen.** Scroll to a game and see its cover, so you can
  find games by picture.
- **Your own colors.** Give each console its own background color in `System/theme.txt`.
- **12-hour clock.** Shows `4:39 PM`, not `16:39`.
- **A tiny settings menu.** Just Date & Time and About. Nothing in it can mess anything up.

Everything else, like lid-close saving, wireless trading, and the cartridge shelf, is slot.'s
work, unchanged.

## Settings

Tap **MENU** on the shelf to set the date and time, or see About. It also reminds you that
L2 / R2 change the brightness.

For a couple more options, edit `System/theme.txt` on the SD card:

| Line | What it does |
|---|---|
| `menu off` | Hide the settings menu, so little hands can't change anything |
| `scrim #F7E7CE` | Background color behind the shelf |
| `picture 3:2` | Show games in the GBA's own shape, with thin black bars above and below. Without it, games fill the whole screen (`picture 4:3`). |
| `sharpness 1.5` | How hard pixel edges are, from `0` (soft) to `2` (nearly hard). `1` is the default and the only setting with no shimmer at all. |
| `scaler shimmerless` | Scale games with sharp-shimmerless instead of Pixel AA. |

## The RG35XXSP's 640×480 screen

Everything is drawn for 640×480 directly, not made for another screen and shrunk to fit:

- **The shelf, menus, clock and About label are laid out for 640×480**, pixel for pixel.
- **The game fills the whole screen.** The GBA is a little wider than 4:3, so games look
  about 11% narrower than on a real GBA. To keep the GBA's exact shape instead, add
  `picture 3:2` to `System/theme.txt`: the game is then 640×427, with thin black bars above
  and below.
- **Sharp pixels, no shimmer.** 240 doesn't go into 640 a whole number of times, so each game
  pixel is 2 or 3 screen pixels wide. The picture is scaled with Pixel AA, the RetroArch
  shader, which keeps every pixel solid and blends only the one screen pixel where two meet,
  mixing them as light rather than as numbers, so edges keep their weight and scrolling
  doesn't shimmer. Down the screen, 4:3 is exactly 3 rows per game pixel, so nothing is
  blended at all.
- **No LCD grid lines.** They only line up at exactly 3× the GBA's size in both directions.

## Setup

1. Set up your RG SP using [slot.'s install guide](https://slot.kowalski.io).
2. Download the latest ezGBA from [releases](../../releases).
3. Unzip it and copy it onto the second SD card, just like slot.
4. **Add box art (optional).** Box art isn't included, since it belongs to the publishers.
   Put a 640×480 PNG in `Backdrops/GBA/`, named the same as the game, for example
   `Backdrops/GBA/Pokemon - FireRed Version (USA).png`. Keep the art in the top 270 pixels
   so the carts don't cover it. Art made for the 720×480 RG SP still works: it is centred
   and loses 40 pixels off each side.

## AI disclosure

Built with Claude's help, on top of slot., which was also built with Claude's help. Every
change was tested on real hardware.
