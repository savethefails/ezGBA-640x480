/// falls back to the default exactly as a typo on the only line does.
///
/// Worth pinning because it has not always been so, and the change arrived quietly with the ini
/// extraction: `read_selected_cores` used to parse line by line and insert only what it could
/// read, which left `Emerald = gpsp` followed by `Emerald = notacore` running gpSP. That is a
/// cart running a core no readable line in the file asks for, and nothing the person holding the
/// card could work out from looking at it. The rule now is the one `ini::write`'s own comment
/// has always claimed — "the later line already won when read" — which is also what entitles it
/// to drop earlier duplicates when it rewrites a line.
///
/// Pinned both ways round, so this is a claim about order rather than about `notacore` losing to
/// whatever it is put beside, and asked of both readers, because the whole point of the
/// extraction is that `core_for` and `read_selected_cores` cannot come to disagree.
