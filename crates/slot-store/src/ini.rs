//! `<key> = <value>`, one per line, under `System/`. The shape every per-cart preference the
//! card keeps is written in, at the layer that knows nothing about what a value means.
//!
//! Keyed on the rom stem, because that is already the key for `Labels/`, `Saves/` and
//! `States/`; a card stays consistent with itself. Nothing here requires that, though — the
//! key is whatever string the caller hands over.
//!
//! Two rules, and both exist because a person edits these files in a text editor on a card:
//!
//! - Every malformed line is skipped rather than raised. The cost of a typo must be that one
//!   entry falls back to its default, never that the shelf fails to load.
//! - A write replaces one line in place and never rebuilds the file from the map, so every
//!   comment, blank line and unparsed line survives — including the note somebody wrote to
//!   themselves above a cart.
//!
//! `selected_core.ini` had all of this to itself and `video_mode.ini` is the second file to
//! want it. The two were within a value type of being the same eighty lines, and two
//! hand-copied parsers is how two files meant to behave identically start to differ.
