/// read by it. That is acceptable — 4× was the fastest speed it had, so it is as close to what
/// was asked as that build can get, and neither build ever finds a speed it cannot explain. A
/// card written at 8 by a build from the night this row had five ceilings falls back the same
/// way, through the same list, exactly as the 255 an adaptive-era card can still hold. The cost,
