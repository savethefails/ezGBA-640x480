/// two devices running the same game agree on a mode without either being told which, and it

/// `link_kind::serial_option`). mGBA gets none of gpSP's options: it has no `gpsp_serial`, and
/// handing it one anyway is a landmine the day it grows one. It does get a frameskip option,
/// below, but under its own prefix — neither core reads the other's — and one of its own that
/// gpSP has no equivalent for, `mgba_sgb_borders`, because mGBA is the core that runs a Game Boy
/// cart and a Super Game Boy border is the one thing it can draw that will not fit the panel.
///
/// `bios` is whether the card carries a real BIOS (`root::has_real_bios`), and it buys the
/// player the boot logo and chime. gpSP defaults to `game`, which drops straight into the
/// cart; `bios` runs the BIOS first. It is only set when the file is really there, because
/// booting through gpSP's built-in replacement instead spends those seconds on a blank screen
/// — a pause that reads as a hang rather than as the hardware starting up.
///
/// `gpsp_bios` is deliberately left alone. Its default, `auto`, already loads
/// `<system>/gba_bios.bin` and uses it whenever the image passes gpSP's own first-byte test,
/// which is the same test `has_real_bios` applies — so naming `official` would select the
/// identical image. All it would change is the failure path, where `official` puts a warning
/// on screen through the core's OSD ("Could not load BIOS image file", "BIOS image seems
/// incorrect") before falling back to exactly the built-in BIOS `auto` falls back to silently.
/// That is a core-drawn message over slot's own chrome, bought for no change in behaviour.
///
/// Setting this on every load, rather than only on a fresh start, is safe because a resume
/// does not survive to be seen: `emu::Worker::run` unserializes the resume state after `load`
/// and before it publishes a single frame, so the restored machine replaces the BIOS's before
/// anything reaches the screen. That covers a reload for a link too — `session::reload_for_link`
/// flushes and resumes through the same path.
///
/// `colour` is the quick menu's Colour Correction, and unlike everything else here it is set on
/// both cores, because both of them have the option — which is worth stating outright, since it
/// was assumed for a while that only mGBA did. Each spells it its own way; see below.

        // is emphatically not a Super Game Boy, so `3` would hand a cart a palette no SP could
