//! Whether a picture is drawn at its own size or stretched over the whole panel, and which of
//! the two each cart was last left in.
//!
//! The Game Boy and the Game Boy Color had no shoulder buttons, so on one of their carts slot
//! takes L and R: L stretches the picture to fill the 3:2 game area, R gives back its own
//! size, centred. On a GBA cart the two are the GBA's own and this file has nothing to say — a
//! GBA picture already fills the 640x427 game area, and there is no second size for it to have.
//!
//! The stretch distorts, deliberately. 160x144 is 10:9 against the 3:2 game area, so a
//! fullscreen Game Boy picture comes out about 35% wider than it is tall. That is what a Game
//! Boy picture blown up to fill a television looked like, and it is the mode the user asked for
//! by name.
