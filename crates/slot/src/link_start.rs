//!
//! Two of the steps are slow enough to be felt: `link_radio::up` blocks for one to five
//! seconds, and `TcpLink::host_until` for up to thirty. Run either on the frame loop and the
//! device is frozen — including the cancel button, which is the one control that matters
//! while a host is waiting for a friend who is not coming. This runs both on a thread of
//! their own and turns them into messages the frame loop picks up in microseconds.
//!
//! It reports the steps as they happen, not just the outcome, for the same reason: a screen
//! that says nothing for thirty seconds and then says "nobody came" is indistinguishable
//! from a crash.
//!
//! Nothing is shared with `App`. `link_radio`'s `up`/`down` are free functions that spawn a
//! process and hold no state, so the worker calls them directly and borrows nothing.
