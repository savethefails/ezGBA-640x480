// frame is therefore free to mean something, because no core packet can ever be one —
// `netpacket_send` drops a null or empty packet two crates away, and `TcpLink::send` refuses
// one again at this end (proved below). That marker plus a one-byte opcode is the whole
// protocol, and the opcode is what makes it extensible rather than a single dead-end signal.

/// The deliberate ending, on the wire. The far end learns it was ended rather than merely
/// discovering a dead socket — which is the entire difference between the two sentences the
/// screen can show, and the difference between ending now and ending `LINK_LOST_MS` later.
///
/// The control frame must also not reach the core: it is a word about the session, not serial
/// traffic, and a gpSP handed it would be handed a byte its partner never sent.
