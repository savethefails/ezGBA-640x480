/// wraps on every press and the same cart is both the selection and a neighbour, so the worry
/// was that scrolling it would read as two carts swapping places rather than as a row turning.
/// A still frame cannot answer that, and neither can a draw list — the shape of the motion is
/// the whole of what is in doubt, so every frame of it is composited, written out to be looked
/// at, and measured.
///
/// What is measured is that the carts on screen are a rigid row: every one of them stands at the
/// same fraction of a pitch off the middle as the others, that fraction only ever moves one way,
/// it never moves further in a frame than the spring can carry it, and it ends up home. A row
/// that swapped its carts, or blinked one out at an edge and back in at the other, breaks the
/// first of those; a row that teleported breaks the third. The shelf of three is here to say the
/// same measurements come back unchanged for a row that was never in question.
///
/// How many carts are on screen is where the two shelves genuinely differ, and the counts below
/// are what they are on purpose. A row of three has exactly three images to give: the moment the
/// press lands, the one that was on the left belongs three slots along instead, which is off the
/// right hand edge, so for a few frames the row is two carts and a space until it comes back in.
/// A row of two has an image in every slot, so nothing is ever missing from it — which is the
/// other half of why the repeat is the layout that scrolls best, and not a thing to tidy into
/// one number for both.
