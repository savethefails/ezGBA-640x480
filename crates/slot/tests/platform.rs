//! Which platform's folders a seated cart's files actually land in, through the real `Session`.
//!
//! `Platform::default()` is `Gba` and every other cart in this crate's tests is a GBA cart, so
//! a session that never stores the platform it opened the core with — or stores it and then
//! ignores it — reads identically to one that does. This is the Game Boy half: the one shape
//! where the value `session.rs` resolves and the value `App` would fall back to differ, and
//! therefore the only thing that can tell storing it apart from assuming it.
//!
//! The same pairing as `gpsp.rs` does for `Core`, and the more dangerous of the two: a wrong
//! core writes a state the other engine cannot read, which shows up the first time the player
//! resumes. A wrong platform writes one game's battery save over another game's, and the two
//! games are told apart by nothing but a folder name.

/// Two carts because one cart on the card is a dedicated device: it boots straight past the
/// shelf and there is no press to make. Both are Game Boy carts, so the shelf's first entry —

/// in this fixture would be the cart that seated instead.
