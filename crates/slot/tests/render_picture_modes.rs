//! L and R on a Game Boy cart, through the whole frontend: the real core, the real cart, the
//! real compositor, composited on the GPU and read back as pixels.
//!
//! The draw list is not the screen and neither is a uniform. This crate has had list
//! assertions pass while the panel was visibly wrong, so the claim "L fills the panel and R
//! gives back the centred picture" is settled here, against the composited frame — and the
//! PNGs are written so the one thing only eyes can judge, what the grille's change of
//! relationship looks like, can actually be looked at.
//!
//! `SCRATCH_PNG_DIR=/tmp cargo test -p slot --test render_picture_modes -- --nocapture`
//!
//! Skipped on a machine with no mGBA dylib and no card to take a cart off, the same way every
//! other test here that needs a real core is.
