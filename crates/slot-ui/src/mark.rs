/// rule could no longer hold both. A badge is drawn inside the HUD's plate, only ever over a
/// running game, and 12 px in and centred in 40 px of depth is the plate's own margin. A mark is
/// drawn on the carousel, where there is no plate at all: the frame it is read against is the
/// screen, and everything else the screen prints — the gauge, the clock — is 24 px in.
///
/// That is also why the size is not bounded by the plate any more. Centred in 40 px the mark's
/// air is `(40 - box) / 2`, so every pixel of growth costs half a pixel of padding at each end,
/// and "bigger, with more room above it" cannot both be had: at today's 50 px box it is already
/// 5 px of overhang before any padding, and 16 px of air inside the plate would leave room for a
/// 6 px machine. So the mark keeps to the screen's margins and the plate, when the HUD raises
/// one, passes behind it. Over the shelf's black backdrop nothing shows; over a wallpaper the
/// plate's lower edge crosses the drawing, for the second and a half the bar is up.

/// of a 100-unit box: even at 32 px that is two thirds of a pixel, so the rasteriser reports two
