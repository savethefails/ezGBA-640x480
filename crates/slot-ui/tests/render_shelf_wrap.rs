//! The carousel wrapping, rasterised one frame per press-frame and tiled into a contact sheet,
//! so the *motion* can be looked at rather than asserted about. A wrap is motion: a still frame
//! cannot show which way the row went, and a draw-list assertion has passed on this file while
//! the row was travelling backwards.
//!
//! Does nothing unless `SCRATCH_DIR` names an output directory:
//!
//! `SCRATCH_DIR=/tmp/wrap cargo test -p slot-ui --test render_shelf_wrap -- --nocapture`
//!
//! Sheets are read left to right, top to bottom, one frame per cell at a third of screen size.
//! No faces are uploaded, so each cart draws as a rect in its own label colour: the colours are
//! the only identity on the row, and they are what says which cart moved where.
