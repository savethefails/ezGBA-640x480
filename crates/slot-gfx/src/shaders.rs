/// texture coordinates. `(0, 0, 1, 1)` is the whole texture and is what every caller that has
/// not asked for anything else gets, which makes that case `0.0 + v_uv * 1.0`: the arithmetic
/// this line did before the uniform existed, to the bit.
///
/// Only the picture is read through it. The mask stays on `v_uv`, which runs 0..1 across the
/// quad — and the quad for the game is the whole panel — so the grille repeats every `u_src.x`
/// of the panel's width whatever the picture is doing. That is what makes a stretch cheap: it
/// changes which part of the texture fills the panel, never the regularity of the grille over
/// it. What it does change is the relationship between the two. At 3x one mask cell sits on
/// exactly one source pixel; stretched, a source pixel is wider than a cell and the grille
/// stops landing on pixel edges. That is what a blown-up Game Boy picture looked like, and it
/// is the honest consequence of the stretch rather than a defect to design around.
///
/// `u_grille` is 1.0 wherever the composite reaches the panel at a whole multiple and 0.0 where
/// it is downscaled (the RG35XXSP's 640x480). Off, the mask is replaced by its own average,
/// `u_flat`, so the picture keeps the brightness it had with the grille rather than jumping by
